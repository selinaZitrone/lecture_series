However, they often lack time to discover new tools and improve their workflows. In this lecture series we will explore a diverse range of topics, including R code quality and efficiency, reproducible document creation, version control with Git, literature management, and academic note taking. You‚Äôll learn practical tips and tricks that can help you optimize your research workflow and increase your productivity.\n\n\n\nüìÖ Every 3rd Thursday üïì 4-5 p.m. üìç Webex\nIf you don‚Äôt want to miss a lecture: Check out the official lecture website and subscribe to the mailing list to get the link to the lecture meeting.\nFor any questions, feedback or topic suggestions send me an email\n\n\n\nOn this website, you can find all slides and additional resources for lectures:\n\n2023-04-20: What they forgot to teach you about R\n2023-05-11: Reproducible documents with Quarto"

You can refer to the following checklist to see where you can still improve your project. For more details please have a look at the slides and the further resources linked below.\n\nProject setup\n\nKeep all of your project files in one location and separate them into sub folders to have a good overview\nMake your project and R Studio Project\nGive your files meaningful names that are machine readable, human readable, and that work well with default ordering\n\n\n\nCode\n\nFollow the standard structure of a code file\nModularize your code and don‚Äôt write one single very long script\nUse save relative paths and avoid setwd() (This is easy if you use R Studio projects)\nFollow a styleguide for your code (e.g.¬†the tidyverse styleguide)\n\nUse the lintr and the styler package to help you with that\n\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\nManage your dependencies with renv to avoid your code from breaking the future"
