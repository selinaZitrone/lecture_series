    "text": "Summary\nThere are many good practice tools and tips that require minimal effort and that can be implemented in your workflow immediately. You can refer to the following checklist to see where you can still improve your project. For more details please have a look at the slides and the further resources linked below.\n\nProject setup\n\nKeep all of your project files in one location and separate them into sub folders to have a good overview\nMake your project and R Studio Project\nGive your files meaningful names that are machine readable, human readable, and that work well with default ordering\n\n\n\nCode\n\nFollow the standard structure of a code file\nModularize your code and don’t write one single very long script\nUse save relative paths and avoid setwd() (This is easy if you use R Studio projects)\nFollow a styleguide for your code (e.g. the tidyverse styleguide)\n\nUse the lintr and the styler package to help you with that\n\n\n\n\nDependencies\n\nManage your dependencies with renv to avoid your code from breaking the future"

This tool streamlines the process of creating reproducible workflows by eliminating the need to copy and paste figures, tables, or numbers. During this lecture, you’ll learn the fundamentals of Quarto and explore practical use cases that you can implement in your data analysis workflow.\n\n📅 11th May 🕓 4-5 p.m. 📍 Webex\n\nFor topic suggestions and/or feedback send me an email\nSubscribe to the mailing list"
