Early-career researchers understand the importance of digital tools for processing data, managing workflows, and enhancing efficiency. However, they often lack time to discover new tools and improve their workflows. In this lecture series we will explore a diverse range of topics, including R code quality and efficiency, reproducible document creation, version control with Git, literature management, and academic note taking. You'll learn practical tips and tricks that can help you optimize your research workflow and increase your productivity.
