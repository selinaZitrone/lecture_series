### Description:

Quarto (the successor of rmarkdown) is a powerful tool that enables the seamless integration of code (R, Python, and more) and its output into a variety of formats such as reports, research papers, presentations, and more. This tool streamlines the process of creating reproducible workflows by eliminating the need to copy and paste figures, tables, or numbers. During this lecture, you'll learn the fundamentals of Quarto and explore practical use cases that you can implement in your data analysis workflow.

- Documents: HTML, PDF, Word, Open Office format
- Presentations: Revealjs (HTML) or Powerpoint
- Websites
- Books: HTML or ePub

## Example project

To get started, you can download the [Quarto demo project](https://github.com/selinaZitrone/quarto_demo/releases/tag/v1) from Github.
It contains some simple and more complex Quarto examples. Have a look at the
README of the the project for more information. If you use R Studio, open the project
by double clicking on the `quarto_demo.Rproj` file.
