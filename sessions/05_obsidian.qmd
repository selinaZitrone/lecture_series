### Description

Effective note taking is crucial for both students and scientist. It's useful to manage tasks, capture key insights from papers, and write down new ideas. In this lecture, I will introduce you to my note taking software of choice. Obsidian is a highly customizable, markdown-based tool that lets you organize your notes efficiently and create interconnected webs of thoughts and ideas (also called "second brain" or "Zettelkasten"). Join me if you want to streamline your note taking process and keep organized records of your tasks, readings and ideas.
