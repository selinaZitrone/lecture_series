## Summary

There are many good practice tools and tips that require minimal effort and that
can be implemented in your workflow immediately. You can refer to the following 
checklist to see where you can still improve your project. For more details please
have a look at the slides and the further resources linked below.

#### Project setup

- Keep all of your project files in one location and separate them into sub folders to
have a good overview
- Make your project and R Studio Project
- Give your files meaningful names that are *machine readable*, *human readable*, and that
work well with *default ordering*

#### Code

- Follow the standard structure of a code file
- Modularize your code and don't write one single very long script
- Use save relative paths and avoid `setwd()` (This is easy if you use R Studio projects)
- Follow a styleguide for your code (e.g. the tidyverse styleguide)
  - Use the `lintr` and the `styler` package to help you with that

#### Dependencies

- Manage your dependencies with `renv` to avoid your code from breaking the future
