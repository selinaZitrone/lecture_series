## Steps of a scientific project

How to properly structure the project?

. . .

I want

-   :arrows_clockwise: Reproduciblity (for you and others)
-   🏋 Reliablity (will it work again?)
-   ⚙ Re-usablity (don't re-invent the wheel)
-   :mag: Visiblity (let others see and use your work)

## How? Use a research compendium!

#### What is a research compendium?

-   Collection of all digital parts of a research project (data + code + text)

::: fragment

:::{style="font-size: 80%;"}
> The goal of a research compendium is to provide a **standard and easily recognizable** way for organizing the digital materials of a project to enable others to **inspect, reproduce, and extend** the research.

From [Marwick et al. 2018](https://doi.org/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986.)

## Principles for building research compendia

-   Stick with the conventions in your field
-   Keep **data**, **methods** and **output** separate
    -   Original data *read only*, output considered *disposable*
-   Specify the computational environment
-   Key components for sharing the compendium include
    -   Licence
    -   Version control
    -   Metadata
    -   Persistent identifier (e.g DOI)

## Examples of different complexities

They are R packages!

## R packages as research compendia

![](images/2023-07-20_research_compendia/Marwicketal2018.png){.r-stretch fig-align="center"}

**Basic idea:** Hijack the R package development ecosystem to build a research compendium

Different use cases, e.g.

-   Publish code, data and analysis scripts alongside your paper
-   Publish a dataset in a way that other people can work with it in R

## Some benefits of R packages

-   Benefit from quality control mechanisms built around R packages
-   Additional packages around this ecosystem to make your life easier
-   Easy documentation
-   Easy sharing of data

# Hands-on: Create a research compendium with the R package structure

> Find a detailed step-by-step guide on the website

## Summary and Conclusions

It's convenient to have standards you can follow

-   R packages provide an helpful development ecosystem that we can hijack for our research compendia
-   You can develop your compendium in different ways
    -   Purpose is for people to install the package in the end
    -   Purpose is just to use the quality checks from R Studio\
-   `usethis` is a great workflow package that allows us to seamlessly follow this workshop

## Outlook

-   Include large datasets with [piggyback](https://github.com/ropensci/piggyback)
-   Automated tests with [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)
-   Unit tests to test your functions using [testthat](https://testthat.r-lib.org/)
-   Easily [connect Github repo to Zenodo](https://emilio-berti.github.io/idiv-git-introduction/21-github_zenodo/index.html) to get a DOI
-   [holepunch package](https://karthik.github.io/holepunch/) to build a Docker image

. . .

The nice thing:

-   Also this easy to set up with `usethis` and friends
-   They are also documented on the lecture series website

## Next lecture

Summer/Conference break in August and September!

. . .

Time for some feedback from you!

Please fill out [the questionnaire](https://forms.gle/xyfNfqd3Ver1Yppq8) if you have time (5 mins)
